This Program generates ADO code and SQL Statements without the use of
an ADO Data Control.  It is available as a stand alone executable or 
as a VB-6.0 AddIn. 

To use the Add-In version, , you must copy the files SQLADOgenAddIn.DLL 
and  BigDynaset.BMP  to your        "C:\Windows\System"    Directory 
and register SQLADOgenAddIn.DLL.  You can register the DLL by selecting 
"Run" from the Windows Start Menu and typing in:

          "C:\Windows\System\REGSVR32.EXE SQLADOgenAddin.dll"


The next time you start VB you can then load the Add-In through the 
Add-In Menu Tab and Add-In Manager.

Please "READ THE INSTRUCTIONS" which are accessed by clicking on the
